Instructions on how to read and use the data files:

(1) These data files contain information for instances having an identical radius for all neighborhood sets (disks). 

(2) Data file "tp-X-Y" contains the information for problem instance "CETSP-X-Y" regardless of the coverage radius value. Example: "tp-12-1" contains the target locations coordinates and the depot for all test problems associated with "CETSP-12-01" (for every value of coverage radius we will obtain a new test instance.)

(3) The first line of each file contains the x- and y-coordinates of the depot for that instance. The subsequent lines contain the x- and y-coordinates of the target locations.
